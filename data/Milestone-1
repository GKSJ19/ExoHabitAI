Data Description
Predicting the Habitability of Exoplanets Using Machine Learning
Dataset Source:
The dataset used in this project is obtained from the NASA Exoplanet Archive, a publicly available and authoritative astronomical database maintained by NASA. The archive aggregates observational data collected from major space missions such as Kepler and TESS.
Dataset Overview:
The NASA Exoplanet Archive provides structured and verified information about exoplanets, their host stars, orbital characteristics, and discovery details. Each record in the dataset represents one exoplanet along with its associated stellar and orbital parameters.
For this project, the Planetary Systems Composite Table is used, as it contains the most complete and cleaned version of confirmed exoplanet data, making it suitable for machine learning analysis.
Attributes Used:
The following attributes are selected because they play a crucial role in determining planetary habitability:
  Attribute	Description:
       - pl_rade	Planet radius (in Earth radii), used to identify rocky planets
       - pl_bmasse	Planet mass (in Earth masses), helps determine atmospheric retention
       - pl_orbper	Orbital period, indicates distance from the host star
       - pl_orbsmax	Semi-major axis (distance from star), used to identify habitable zone
       - pl_eqt	Planet equilibrium temperature, key indicator for liquid water
       - st_teff	Host star effective temperature
       - st_rad	Host star radius
       - st_mass	Host star mass
Target Variable:
The dataset does not provide a direct label for planetary habitability. Therefore, a binary target variable named habitable is derived using scientifically accepted criteria.
1 → Habitable
0 → Not Habitable
The habitability label is generated based on conditions such as:
     * Planet radius less than 1.6 Earth radii
     * Equilibrium temperature within a suitable range for liquid water
Data Characteristics:
Data Type: Structured, numerical
Format: CSV
Source: Real observational space mission data
Missing Values: Present in some attributes and handled during preprocessing
Summary:
The NASA Exoplanet Archive dataset provides comprehensive planetary and stellar information necessary for analyzing and predicting the habitability of exoplanets. Its scientific validity and 
structured nature make it an appropriate and effective dataset for this machine learning-based project.
