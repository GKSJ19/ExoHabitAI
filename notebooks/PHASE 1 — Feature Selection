# Phase 1 — Feature Selection

## 📌 Objective
Select scientifically meaningful core features from the raw NASA Exoplanet dataset that are relevant for habitability analysis and planetary characterization.

---

## 📂 Input
- Raw CSV file from **NASA Exoplanet Archive**
- File contains ~39,000+ records and ~289 columns

---

## 🧠 Approach
- Load dataset while ignoring metadata headers
- Inspect structure and column names
- Select only **physically meaningful planetary and stellar features**

---

## 🧪 Selected Features
| Feature | Description |
|------|------------|
| pl_rade | Planet radius (Earth radius) |
| pl_masse | Planet mass (Earth mass) |
| pl_orbper | Orbital period (days) |
| pl_orbsmax | Semi-major axis (AU) |
| pl_eqt | Equilibrium temperature (K) |
| pl_dens | Planet density |
| st_teff | Star effective temperature |
| st_lum | Star luminosity |
| st_met | Star metallicity |
| st_spectype | Star spectral type |
