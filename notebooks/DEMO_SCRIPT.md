## 📽️ Scene 1: Introduction (0:00 – 0:30)

### Script:

Hello, I’m [Your Name], and this is ExoHabitAI.

ExoHabitAI is an AI-powered web application designed to predict
the habitability of exoplanets using real astronomical parameters.

Our system analyzes planetary, stellar, and orbital data inspired
by NASA’s exoplanet research to identify Earth-like worlds.

In this demo, I’ll walk you through how ExoHabitAI predicts,
ranks, and visualizes habitable planets using machine learning
and interactive data analytics.

Let’s begin.


### Actions:
1. Show ExoHabitAI title and branding
2. Display tagline: “Discover Earth 2.0 with AI”
3. Pause briefly before entering Home page

---

## 📽️ Scene 2: Home Page (0:30 – 1:15)

### Script:

This is the Home page of ExoHabitAI.

Here, we introduce the concept of discovering Earth-like planets
beyond our solar system using artificial intelligence.

The animated orbital system represents planets revolving around
a star, symbolizing real exoplanetary systems.

The design uses a modern dark-space theme with smooth animations
to give a scientific yet cinematic experience.

From here, users can start predictions or explore NASA’s
exoplanet database directly.


### Actions:
1. Show animated orbit system
2. Highlight project title and description
3. Hover over navigation bar (Home, Prediction, Ranking, Visualization)
4. Click “Get Started”

**Visual Focus:** Orbit animation, glowing buttons, dark space UI

## 📽️ Scene 3: Prediction Page (1:15 – 3:00)

### Script:

Now we are on the Prediction page, which is the core feature
of ExoHabitAI.

Here, the input parameters are divided into three sections.

The first section contains Planet Parameters such as mass,
radius, density, orbital period, and temperature.

The second section focuses on Stellar Parameters like star
temperature, luminosity, metallicity, age, and spectral type.

The third section includes System and Transit parameters such
as distance, transit depth, orbital alignment, and number of
planets in the system.


### Actions:
1. Scroll slowly through all three input panels
2. Point to each section title

---

### ▶️ Load Sample Data

### Script:

For demonstration purposes, I’ll click on Load Sample Data.

This automatically fills the input fields with realistic
astronomical values and simulates live data streaming.

This feature is useful for quick testing and demonstrations.


### Actions:
3. Click “Load Sample Data”
4. Show animated input filling effect

---

### ▶️ Run Prediction

### Script:

Now I’ll click on Predict Habitability.

The system processes the input data, calculates the Earth
Similarity Index, and evaluates habitability using AI logic.


### Actions:
5. Click “Predict Habitability”
6. Show loading screen with percentage and system logs

---

### ✅ Result Output

### Script:

Here we can see the prediction result.

The system classifies the planet as either Habitable or
Non-Habitable.

It also displays:

Confidence percentage

Planet name

Threshold value

Earth Similarity Index score

This clear output makes the prediction easy to understand,
even for non-technical users.


### Actions:
7. Highlight result card
8. Point to confidence, ESI score, and status badge

**Visual Focus:** Result card glow, confidence score, color coding

---

## 📽️ Scene 4: Ranking Page (3:00 – 4:00)

### Script:

Next, let’s move to the Ranking page.

This section displays a ranked list of exoplanets based on
their habitability confidence scores.

Planets are clearly labeled as Habitable or Non-Habitable,
making comparison simple and intuitive.


### Actions:
1. Navigate to Ranking
2. Scroll through ranking table

---

### ▶️ Filters & Summary

### Script:

Users can filter the results by minimum score and number
of planets to display.

The summary cards at the top show:

Total candidates

Filtered results

Highest habitability score

This helps researchers quickly identify the best candidates.


### Actions:
3. Change filter values
4. Click “Apply Filters”
5. Highlight summary cards

**Visual Focus:** Ranking table, filters, summary metrics

---

## 📽️ Scene 5: Visualization Page (4:00 – 5:30)

### Script:

The Visualization page provides graphical insights into
the habitability data.

At the top, we see key statistics such as total planets,
habitable planets, non-habitable planets, and average confidence.


### Actions:
1. Navigate to Visualization
2. Point to KPI cards

---

### 📊 Charts Explanation

### Script:

The pie chart shows the overall distribution of habitable
and non-habitable planets.

The bar chart represents how confidence scores are distributed
across different ranges.

Finally, the horizontal chart displays the top 10 planets
with the highest confidence scores.

These visualizations make complex data easy to interpret.


### Actions:
3. Point to pie chart
4. Scroll to bar chart
5. Highlight Top 10 chart

**Visual Focus:** Charts, smooth animations, data clarity

## 📽️ Scene 6: Technical Overview (5:30 – 6:30) *(Optional)*

### Script:

From a technical perspective, ExoHabitAI combines:

Machine learning-based habitability prediction logic

A responsive frontend built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Chart.js for interactive visualizations

A modular and scalable design

The system is fast, interactive, and easy to extend.


### Actions:

## 📽️ Scene 7: Closing (6:30 – 7:00)

### Script:

In conclusion, ExoHabitAI demonstrates how artificial intelligence
can assist in identifying potentially habitable exoplanets.

It combines scientific data, intelligent analysis, and modern
visualization into a single interactive platform.

Thank you for watching.
I’ll be happy to answer any questions.
