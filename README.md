# ExoHabitAI

## Project Description
ExoHabitAI is an AI-based system that predicts the habitability potential of exoplanets using planetary and stellar parameters.

🚀 Key Features
🧠 AI Analysis Core
Machine Learning Model: Uses a Random Forest Classifier trained on 4,000+ synthetic exoplanet data points.

Predictive Logic: Analyzes planetary radius, stellar flux, equilibrium temperature, and mass to determine the likelihood of liquid water.

🌍 Dynamic 3D Visualization (New!)
Real-Time Rendering: The planet model mutates based on user input:

Magma World: Glowing red surface for high temperatures (>330K).

Ice World: Reflective, frozen surface for low temperatures (<200K).

Gas Giant: Thick, hazy atmosphere for large radii (>1.6 Earths).

Terra Class: Blue oceans and clouds for habitable zones.

📜 Commander's Mission Log
Persistent History: Automatically saves every scan to the browser's local storage.

Quick Recall: Users can revisit previous predictions instantly.

Report Generation: Download detailed text reports for mission analysis.
